title: About
---

I'm Marc, a renewable energy systems engineer who has developed a passion for functional
programming and eventually ended up in the backend team developing software for a `virtual
power plant <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_kmmAt6CQE>`_ with Haskell_ and Nix_ at tiko_.

In my spare time, I love running in the forest (and sometimes just walking with my two cats),
and contributing to the open source community.
I also maintain a few of `my own open source projects<https://github.com/mrcjkb?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=>`_.

My development environment consists mostly of NixOS_, XMonad_ and Neovim_.
