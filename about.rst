Hi there! I'm Marc, a renewable energy systems engineer with a passion for functional programming.
I currently work on developing software for a `virtual
power plant <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_kmmAt6CQE>`_ using Haskell_ and Nix_, as part of the backend team at tiko_.

In my free time, I love running in the forest, taking leisurely walks with my two cats,
and contributing to the open source community.
I also maintain a `a few projects of my own <https://github.com/mrcjkb?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=>`_.

My development environment consists mainly of NixOS_, XMonad_ and Neovim_, running on a Tuxedo_ computer.
