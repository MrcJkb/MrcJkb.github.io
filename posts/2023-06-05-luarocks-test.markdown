In my [last post](https://mrcjkb.dev/posts/2023-01-10-luarocks-tag-release.html),
I wrote about some pain points in the Neovim plugin ecosystem,
and introduced the [luarocks-tag-release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/luarocks-tag-release)
GitHub action, which allows you to publish your Neovim plugins to [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/).

At the end, I stated that I was planning to play around with a few ideas:

> - Perhaps a package manager as a proof-of-concept?
> - Maybe a package that can use Neovim as an interpreter to run LuaRocks
>   so that it can use Neovim's Lua API in test runs?

...and I ended up going down the second rabbit hole.

## Why not just use `plenary.nvim` to test plugins?

Before Neovim 0.9, the status quo for Lua plugins has been to use [`plenary.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
for testing.
This still seems to be the case for many (including my own plugins, as of writing this post).
Popular plugin templates still use `plenary-test` in their CI.

For example:

- [nvim-lua/nvim-lua-plugin-template](https://github.com/nvim-lua/nvim-lua-plugin-template/blob/57565ed685c1fe2d16022b2d128092becac802eb/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L26)
- [ellisonleao/nvim-plugin-template](https://github.com/ellisonleao/nvim-plugin-template/blob/29d9752/Makefile)


What are the downsides of using `plenary-test`?

For one thing, it is a stripped-down re-implementation of [`busted`](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/).
As such, it only supports [a small subset of busted items](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim/blob/499e0743cf5e8075cd32af68baa3946a1c76adf1/doc/plenary-test.txt#LL55C1-L64C1).

Another downside is that different plugins have different approaches at managing the
`plenary-test` dependency. An approach I see quite often is to clone the plenary.nvim
repository into `$HOME/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/vendor/start`
and then to symlink it to the project's root or parent directory.
This is not very intuitive for potential contributors.
Plus, the fact that many plugins use `git clone` to fetch the `HEAD` of plenary.nvim's
`master` branch, is not ideal for reproducibility.

## Enter Neovim 0.9

Neovim 0.9 [added support for running lua scripts](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#-l)
with the CLI using `-l`.
Combine this with `-c lua [...]`, and Neovim becomes a full-fledged LuaJIT interpreter that
includes the [Neovim lua API](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html).

To test this out, you can create a `sayHello.lua` file with the following content:

```lua
vim.print { "Hello", name }
```

Then run

```console
nvim -c 'lua name = "teto"' -l sayHello.lua
> { "Hello", "teto" }
```

As it turns out, it's quite easy to run `busted` tests using Neovim 0.9+ as the interpreter.

## How to test your plugin with `busted`

### Prerequisites

- If your plugin has any dependencies, it is a lot easier to set up
  if they [are available on LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/labels/neovim).
- So in case they aren't, open an issue asking to publish releases to LuaRocks,
  e.g. using the [luarocks-tag-release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/luarocks-tag-release)
  GitHub action.
- Install `luarocks` using your distro's package manager
  and also install `LuaJIT` or `Lua 5.1`.
  The version doesn't matter, since we'll be using Neovim as the interpreter.
  But `luarocks` needs a real Lua installation that exposes its C libraries to
  install dependencies.

### Preparing your plugin

If your plugin has any dependencies, add a [rockspec](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Rockspec-format)
named `<my-plugin>-scm-1.rockspec`[^1] to your project's root.

[^1] Replace `<my-plugin>` with the name of your plugin.

A minimal rockspec might look something like this:

```lua
rockspec_format = '3.0'
package = '<my-plugin>'
version = 'scm-1'

test_dependencies = {
  'lua >= 5.1',
  'plenary.nvim',
}

source = {
  url = 'git://github.com/mrcjkb/' .. package,
}

build = {
  type = 'builtin',
}
```

Next, add a `.busted` file to your project root, with the following content:

```lua
return {
  _all = {
    coverage = false,
    lpath = "lua/?.lua;lua/?/init.lua",
  },
  default = {
    verbose = true,
  },
  tests = {
    verbose = true,
  },
}
```

> **Note**
>
> The `lpath` is necessary to tell `busted` to look for your plugin's source
> code in the `lua` directory.

Finally, add a `run-tests.sh` script:

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
```sh
#!/bin/sh
BUSTED_VERSION="2.1.2-3"
luarocks init
luarocks install busted "$BUSTED_VERSION"
luarocks config --scope project lua_version 5.1
nvim \
  -c "lua package.path='lua_modules/share/lua/5.1/?.lua;lua_modules/share/lua/5.1/?/init.lua;'..package.path;package.cpath='lua_modules/lib/lua/5.1/?.so;'..package.cpath;local k,l,_=pcall(require,'luarocks.loader') _=k and l.add_context('busted','$BUSTED_VERSION')" \
  -l "lua_modules/lib/luarocks/rocks-5.1/busted/$BUSTED_VERSION/bin/busted" "$@"
```
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

and make it executable:

```console
chmod +x run-tests.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x run-tests.sh
```

That's it! The script uses `luarocks` to install `busted` and configures
Neovim to be able to find it using the `-c` argument.
It then runs `busted` with the `-l` argument,
and forwards any arguments you pass to the script.
The `.busted` file and the rockspec tell `busted` how to find your plugin
and its dependencies.

For example, if your tests are in a directory named `tests`, you can call

```console
./run-tests.sh tests
```

Without any arguments, `busted` looks for `*_spec.lua` files in
a directory named `spec`.


## Using GitHub Actions to run tests

Since version 5.0, the `luarocks-tag-release` GitHub action will automatically
run tests if it finds a `.busted` file in the project root.
By default, it will run [`luarocks test`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/test)
with both the stable Neovim release (version 0.9 as of writing)
and Neovim nightly as the Lua interpreter[^2],
before publishing the plugin to LuaRocks.

[^2] `luarocks-tag-release` updates the Neovim interpreters weekly.

There is a [PR](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/luarocks-tag-release/pull/36) that will
allow tests to be run without releasing to LuaRocks for each pull request.

> **Note**
>
> `luarocks-tag-release` uses [`neorocks`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/neorocks),
> a LuaRocks [nix](https://nixos.org/) derivation configured to use Neovim, to run the tests.

For plugin authors who do not wish to publish their plugins to LuaRocks,
I will leave writing a GitHub Action as an exercise üòà.
